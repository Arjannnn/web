      <h3 style='color:white'>This is our group's game called Beautifully Built Cars. In this game, the player is able to customize the type of car, size of the wheels, and whether or not they want their car to have a top hat or not. It is a customizable game and we used turtle, if statements, and a while loop to code the game.</h3>

Lists and while loops were used to code movement and strings were used for a leaderboard.</h3>
